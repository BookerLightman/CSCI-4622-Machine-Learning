# CSCI 4622 Calendar

**Notes**:
- This schedule is a rough approximation and subject to change.
- Reading assignments are from _Introduction to Statistical Learning_, by James et. al.
- Homework is due on Moodle by 5pm on Friday the week **after** the assignment is listed.
- All in-class notebooks will be posted [here](https://github.com/chrisketelsen/CSCI-4622-Machine-Learning/tree/master/inclass-notebooks)

<!---
1. Regression Refresher (because theyâ€™ve just seen this in 3022) and I can use it to introduce Bias-Variance Trade-Off
2. KNN 
3. Perceptron 
4. Logistic Regression and SGD 
5. Neural Nets 
6. Feature Engineering 
7. Simple Learning Theory 
8. SVMs
